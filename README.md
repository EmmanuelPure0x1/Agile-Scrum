### Scrum

- The Process: 
	- The Product Owner builds the product backlog and the development team prioritise it.
	- The team then looks at this backlog and they pull work from it. Then team decides how much stuff they can take into the scrum and what they can deliver in a cycle (the sprint backlog).
	- Inside the cycle the team must have a daily meeting. This is used to synchronise everyone within the team.
	- At the end of the cycle the team have to produce working software, and potentially shippable working software.
- The key difference between Agile and Scrum is that while Agile is a project management philosophy which utilizes a core set of values or principles, Scrum is a specific Agile methodology that is used to facilitate a project
- **Product Owner:** Owns the Product Backlog. Essentially the Product Owner directs the team to ensure they are working on the right requirements.
**Scrum Master:** This role does not direct the team like a Project Manager and allocate tasks, instead they shield the team from outside distractions and remove blockers to enable the team to work as quickly as possible.
