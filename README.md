- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

### Scrum

- The Process: 
	- The Product Owner builds the product backlog and the development team prioritise it.
	- The team then looks at this backlog and they pull work from it. Then team decides how much stuff they can take into the scrum and what they can deliver in a cycle (the sprint backlog).
	- Inside the cycle the team must have a daily meeting. This is used to synchronise everyone within the team.
	- At the end of the cycle the team have to produce working software, and potentially shippable working software.

- The **key difference between Agile and Scrum** is that while Agile is a project management philosophy which utilizes a core set of values or principles, Scrum is a specific Agile methodology that is used to facilitate a project

- **Product Owner:** Owns the Product Backlog. Essentially the Product Owner directs the team to ensure they are working on the right requirements.
**Scrum Master:** This role does not direct the team like a Project Manager and allocate tasks, instead they shield the team from outside distractions and remove blockers to enable the team to work as quickly as possible.

- Other Roles also include:
	- PM - Project Management
	- BA - Business Analyst
	- QA - Quality Assurance team
	- UX - User Experience team (aka Front-End)
	- DEV - Development Team

- Scrum Ceremonies:

	- Sprint Planning: This happens on day 1 of the Sprint and is where the team members create the Sprint Backlog.
	- Daily Scrum Meeting: These are used to synchronize the work of the team. The meeting should last no more than 15 minutes. Each team member discusses what they worked on yesterday, what they’re working on today, and any blockers they’re facing.
	- Sprint Retrospective: (aka Sprint Review) This occurs at the end of the Sprint and gives the entire team the opportunity to examine the Sprint just completed and identify improvement opportunities for the next Sprint

- The Three Amigos:

	- The Business Analyst details out each of the Business Requirements with the team.
	- The members of the Quality Assurance Team discuss the Test Cases already created for these business requirements.
	- The members of the Development Team discuss the architecture and the low-level design with the team.
